Hi! I'm Darko. I develop software for fun and profit using (mostly) JavaScript and related stuff (TypeScript, for one), since it's everywhere these days. I like working on the "fringes", experimenting with new APIs and fresh ideas. Software development should have at least *SOME* fun in it.

Darko in bullet points:

* Runs a company called [Foundry](https://foundry.mk) - as long as it's a challenge, we're happy to take on it. 
* Works with a some very cool companies and people - https://www.panther.co/, https://anne4care.nl/en/i-am-anne/, https://tribevibe.earth/, to name a few.
* Runs a local JS meetup, [BeerJS Skopje](https://beerjs.mk/).
* A through and through Linux-loving commie.
* But also a gamer, <strike>so I may or may not dual boot to the OS that I shall not name</strike>. Update: no longer the case, since [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/) became a thing.
* Loves growing peppers - currently growing 40+ species, of the extremely hot ones and I'd like to automate the process as much as possible. 
* Believes PWAs are good enough, and can't wait for a more distributed / decentralized future (browsers are pretty powerful these days, y'know).
* Draws and paints to relax, and even had an exhibition recently. One of these days I may even make a portfolio for that.
* Loves and plays D&D as much as possible.
* Brews his own beer.
* Usually doesn't refer to himself in third person.

I'm NOT looking for employment opportunities. Consultancies, educational gigs, talks and workshops I can all do and love doing, but I'm NOT looking for a job.
